2.0 Build 0081 (03-06-2006) :

- modifications to feature MWGD44 (F-39)

SEARCH_SYMBOL rules are bound to a file name and section name and the 
search rules accumulate for each unique file:section combination in the LCF.

Example:

	SECTIONS {
		main: {
			SEARCH_SYMBOL ov1;
				file1.o(.text)  # use ov1 section to resolve references to duplicate
								# symbols in file1.o .text section
		} > main
		
		main.bss {
			SEARCH_SYMBOL grpB;
				file1.o(.bss)	# Use overlay group 'grpB' search rule for file1.o .bss section
		} > main.bss
	}
	
In the example above, the combinations, 'file1.o:.text' and 'file1.o:.bss' have different
SEARCH_SYMBOL rules. This differs from build 80, where once the rule was set for a file,
it would not change for the file.  
		
Example:

	SECTIONS {
		ov1: {
			SEARCH_SYMBOL ov3;
			file1.o(.text);
		} > ov1
		
		main: {
			SEACH_SYMBOL Default_module;
			*(.text)
		} > main
		
In this case, the symbol search rule is now "ov3,Default_module". The file wildcard
specifier adds the "Default_module" lookup rule to each link file in the project.


When a reference is made to a duplicate symbol, the linker checks the file and section
in which the reference occurs and selects the appropriate rule based on the file,section
name combination. 

		

2.0 Build 0080 (02-25-2006) :

- implemented feature MWGD44 (F-39):


The linker now allows duplicate symbols to be defined in different
overlay groups. References to multiply defined symbols can be
resolved with the SEARCH_SYMBOL directive in the linker control
file (LCF).

Prior to build 80 of the linker, duplicate symbol definitions were
only allowed in different overlays of the same overlay group. For
example, this was not acceptable:

og1
  ovl11
    define funcA
  ovl12
    define funcA

og2
  ovl21
    define funcA  ===> redefinition error.

call funcA ==>    how to resolve funcA? Not possible prior to build 80.

Build 80 now allows the case above to continue without a redefinition error. 
However, the call to funcA is still ambiguous.

Neither an external call (call from non-explicit overlay function) nor
a call from another overlay could successfully
be linked because the linker cannot know the desired symbol to be linked.

To inform the linker of which symbol should be used to resolve the ambiguous
symbol definition,  a new directive is introduced into the LCF, SEARCH_SYMBOL.

  SEARCH_SYMBOL {search name} [, {search name} ] ;

SEARCH_SYMBOL provides a list of overlay group names and/or overlay names
that the linker uses to resolve ambiguous symbol references. The list is
searched in the order specified. 

SEARCH_SYMBOL is specified in the section where the reference to the ambiguous
symbol is expected to occur. The linker searches all the symbols that match
the reference and then checks the overlay group and the overlay where the
symbol was defined. For example:

og1
  ovl11
    define funcA
  ovl12
    define funcA

og2
  ovl21
    call funcA
    
The linker control file would specify: 

SECTIONS {

.ovl11: {
    <files and sections for ovl11>
     ...
} > ovl11

.ovl12 omitted...

.ovl21: {
   SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl11;
   <files and sections for ovl21>
   ...
} > ovl21

}

to indicate that the reference to funcA in ovl21 should use the definition
in ovl11. Without this specification, the linker has no idea which funcA
definition to use.

A symbol may be multiply defined outside an overlay context and within
and overlay context. Any references to such multiply defined symbols 
must be resolved with SEARCH_SYMBOL. For example:

define funcA

og1
  ovl11
    define funcA
  ovl12
    define funcA

call funcA

The external call to funcA is ambiguous, the linker cannot decide which funcA to call.
To call the external definition, specify the search symbol as:

SECTIONS {
.main: {
    SEARCH_SYMBOL MAIN;
} > main
}

Similarly, any static (non-overlay) module may be specified by SEARCH_SYMBOL.
For example:


SECTIONS {
.mymodule: {
    SEARCH_SYMBOL mymodule;
	define funcA
	reference to funcA
} > mymodule
}

In this case, funcA may be multiply defined in overlay modules. The reference to funcA
in 'mymodule' is resolved by the definition in 'mymodule' according to SEARCH_SYMBOL.
'mymodule' is not actually an overlay nor an overlay group name. So the linker,
seeing that 'mymodule' does not match any known overlay group names or overlay
names, sets the search space to "MAIN", that is, the implicit root overlay name. 
So "SEARCH_SYMBOL mymodule;" is equivalent to "SEARCH_SYMBOL MAIN;" .

NOTE: THE OPERATION BELOW HAS CHANGED IN BUILD 81:

The SEARCH_SYMBOL specification is bound to a file name within the section specifier.
Once a file has been associated with a SEARCH_SYMBOL specification within a 
section definition, it cannot be changed:

SECTIONS {
  .mymodule: {
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl1;
          file1.o(.text)
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl2
          file1.o(.data) # ===> NO! ovl1 SEARCH_SYMBOL specification is bound to file1.o
                                for the remainder of the section

SECTIONS {
  .mymodule: {
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl1;
          file1.o(.text)
   } > mymodule

  .mymodule_data: {
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl2;
          file1.o(.data) # ===> NO! SEARCH_SYMBOL specification for file1.o is reset to
                                ovl2, symbol resolution using ovl1 will not work.
   } > mymoduledata


However, a different SEARCH_SYMBOL specification may be specified for each file
within a section.

SECTIONS {
  .mymodule: {
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl1;
          file1.o(.text)
     SEARCH_SYMBOL ovl2;
          file2.o(.text) # ===> OK!  file1.o uses ovl1 search rule, file2 uses ovl2 search rule 


The situation is slightly different for a file re-used in multiple overlays (this
feature implemented in build 79 of the linker). Each instance of a re-used file
in the overlays may have its own SEARCH_SYMBOL specification.

SECTIONS {

  ovlC:ovlC {
      file1.o(.text)
      SEARCH_SYMBOL ovlA;
      filecommon.o(.text)
  } > ovlC

  ovlD:ovlD {
      file2.o(.text)
      SEACH_SYMBOL ovlB; 
      filecommon.o(.text)
  }
	
In this case, ovlA is searched in order to resolve references occurring in ovlC filecommon.o.
OvlB is searched to resolved references occuring in OvlD filecommon.o.
The reason for this is that each instance of a shared overlay file is treated as 
a unique file by the linker and thus may have it's own SEARCH_SYMBOL specification.

END CHANGES FOR BUILD 81

Note that a call within an overlay is always resolved by the definition
of the symbol within the overlay, even if there are multiple symbol definitions.
For example:

og1
  ovl11
    define funcA
    call funcA
  ovl12
    define funcA

og2
  ovl21
    defined funcA

The call to funcA in ovl11 is resolved by the definition of funcA in ovl11.



2.0 Build 0079 (02-16-2006) :

- implemented feature MWGD53 (F-38):

Linker now allows duplicate filenames in different overlays.

The linker now allows the following example to link properly:

.sec1:ovl1 {
	file1.o (.text)
	file3.o (.text)
} > seg1

.sec2:ovl2 {
	file2.o (.text)
	file3.o (.text)
} > seg2

In this case, file3.o is a component of the overlays "ovl1" and "ovl2". 

Note the new linker control file syntax that allows the overlay name to be 
specified explicitly following the section specifier. The overlay name is optional. 
It is only required when a file or files is shared among overlays. The overlay name
must match the name of the overlay specified on the command line with the -overlay
(-ol) flag. 

The above syntax is equivalent to

.sec1: {
	GROUP(ovl1) (.text)
} > seg1

.sec2: {
	GROUP(ovl2) (.text)
} > seg2 

Note that in the usage of GROUP(<name>), <name> refers to an overlay specified with
-overlay, _not_ the overlay group name specified with -overlaygroup.

Library names may be used in place of object file names:

Example:

.sec1:ovl1 {
	file1.o (.text)
	lib1.a (.text)
} > seg1

.sec2:ovl2 {
	file2.o (.text)
	lib1.a (.text)
} > seg2

Normally, a warning is issued for duplicate file names on the command line. No
warning is issued for duplicate files that exist as part of an overlay group.

Files may not be shared in overlays in different overlay groups. 

This feature applies only to the command line linker, as the IDE does not have the
ability to duplicate a file in overlay groups.


2.0 Build 0078 (01-31-2006) :

- implemented feature MWGD52, show warning for different structs in different files.

This feature will detect when class/structs/union with the same struct/class/union names are 
defined differently in separate files.

Debugging must be enabled in the compilation of the files to be checked, that is,
DWARF2 debugging information (.debug_info sections, etc.) must be present in the
files being checked.

When the linker comes across 2 DWARF2 class/struct/union type symbols with the same name, 
it first checks whether one of these are a place-holder type (that is, a forward
declaration having a struct size of 0). The place-holder type 
will be replaced by the other class/struct/union type. If both are place-holder type, 
then the newer one will be ignored. 

If both symbols are not place-holder type, the linker will then check for the size 
of the struct of each symbol, and generate a warning if they are different. The linker 
will also ignore the newer one. Note this affects only the DWARF2 symbols.

The following warning is emitted if the the class/struct/union sizes are different:

Warning : The name <name> has been used for different structs/classes/
          unions.

The linker will check if two struct tags have identical names
2.0 Build 0077 (10-17-2005) :
- fixed MTWX19574, by updating how the linker handle symbols with MULTIDEF
