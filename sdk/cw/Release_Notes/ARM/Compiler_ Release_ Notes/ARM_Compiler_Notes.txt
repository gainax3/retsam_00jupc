- Feature DS-R18,DS-R19

Introduction
------------

Currently, the ARM compiler generates a BL <symbolname> instruction whenever a 
function call is encountered in the source being compiled. The BL instruction 
in both ARM and Thumb modes has a fixed offset that determines the maximum 
range of the branch target jump. 

At link time, the linker determines the operating state of the caller function 
(ARM or Thumb), the operating state of the callee, and the range of the jump. 
If the interworking switch of the linker is on, the linker either replaces the 
compiler generated BL instruction with a BLX instruction (to switch operating 
states) or replaces the target of the BL instruction with a branch to a small 
piece of code called a veneer. The veneer will switch operating states if necessary 
and branch to the original target.  Veneers are generated if a state switch is 
required or if the branch is out of the range of the BL instruction. The exact 
contents of the veneer depend on the ARM architecture type and capabilities (v4t or v5t). 

The features requested will force the compiler to generate a fixed sequence of 
instructions that allow a branch range of 32-bits using the BLX Rm for ARM v5t 
or BX Rm for ARM v4t. In this specification, such functions that require register 
direct branching instructions are referred to as "far" functions.

Defining Far Functions
----------------------

There are two means to define far functions. The first means is simpler and uses 
the __declspec(far_call) syntax. The second means determines if the function is
attached to a section whose addressing mode is "far_abs" to annotate the function
as "far".

Interworking must be enabled for the new features to be in effect.


Using __declspec(far_call)
--------------------------

First, __declspec(far_call) is provided as a means of directly annotating a function
to be called by a register direct call. Simply prepend the __declspec to the function
prototype or definition.

Example:

__declspec(far_call) extern void function1(void);


Using the far_abs Addressing Mode
---------------------------------

As a second means, far functions may be identified by the addressing mode of the section 
which they reside.

The user must define a section that has a "far_abs" addressing mode. 

Refer to the targeting manual for #pragma define_section syntax details, but minimally a far
section would look like:

Example:
#pragma define_section FARSECT ".farsect" far_abs RX

"far_abs" is a new address mode introduced in this build.

Next, the user must designate which functions reside in the far section. This is done
by a __declspec or #pragma.

__declspec(<sectname>) <function prototype>

or

__declspec(section "<sectname>") <function prototype>

Example:

__declspec(section "FARSECT") int farfunc(int);


Alternatively, #pragma section <sectname> begin/end syntax can be used if the function
is defined in the same file as the #pragma define_section.

Example:
#pragma section FARSECT begin
int farfunc(int i)
{
	return i++;
}
#pragma section FARSECT end

int main()
{
	int j=0;
	j = farfunc(j);
}

If the far function is defined in another module (an extern function), the #pragma define_section
and __declspec or #pragma section must also be specified in the module containing the function
definitions and must be identical to the #pragma define_section, __declspec, or
#pragma section that references the far function.

Example:

main.c
======

#pragma define_section FARSECT ".farsect" far_abs RX
__declspec(section "FARSECT") extern void farfunc(int);

int main()
{
	farfunc(3);
}

file1.c
=======

#pragma define_section FARSECT ".farsect" far_abs RX
__declspec(section "FARSECT") extern void farfunc(int);

void farfunc(int j)
{
	return;
}

Of course, the linker control file must place the ELF section ".farsect" appropriately.
A 'far_abs' section does not imply any restrictions on placement in the memory map.

Caveats
-------

1. For ARM v4t architectures (e.g. ARM7TDMI), it is not possible to return to the 
Thumb operating state from a far function call.

Example (Thumb mode)
ldr r1,[pc+16]	;load address of far function
mov lr,pc
bx r1       
... more thumb instructions ...

A return from the far function will return in ARM mode because
v4t mov lr,pc does not preserve the operating state of the machine.

This is not an issue in v5t, since blx preserves the operating state
of the machine.

A warning is issued for any far function calls for v4t machines:

 Warning : Return from far function call in v4t machine will not restore Thumb
           state

2. Designating a function as a far function will not prevent automatic inlining if the
reference and definition of the function are in the same file and automatic inlining
is enabled. Automatic inlining can be suppressed with __attribute__((noinline)), however.

Example:

__declspec(section "FARSECT")  void farfunc(int) __attribute__((noinline));

error message is wrong.

- fixed MTWX21451 , When run in debug mode, the software prints out that the "Character is 
ACTIVE". In release mode it says "Character is INACTIVE". Should be "ACTIVE" though.

- fixed MTWX21138, The compiler has a problem with the base class when it is used in partial 
specialization.

- fixed MTWX21098 , code sample worked properly on NITRO/DS 1.2 but not on 2.0. Should print "stack 1" however it prints "stack 0"

(Nitro-SDK function) is used and debug info is not generated. 

Note: Since MI_CpuXXX16/32 is instantiated from a precompiled header file with
debug options that differ from the file that includes the precompiled header,
no debug information is generated for the functions in the including file or
the precompiled header functions. All functions in a single translation unit
(file) should have equivalent debug settings to generate consistent debug 
information as debug information is emitted for the entire file, not 
individual functions. Although it is possible to having different debug settings
on different functions (via precompiled headers as described above or by 
#pragma sym on|off|reset), the exactness of the debugging information is
controlled by the order of compilation, over which the user has no control.

- fixed issue where Debug builds of certain Nitro SDK applications could not
be debugged. The message "Program entry point is not found" would appear in 
a dialog box. 

3.0 Build 110 (03-03-2006)

- fixed MTWX20414, The behavior of the Nitro-SDK Demo "demos/mb/cloneboot" 
  is not perfect
  
- fixed MTWX20415, An exception error occurs in ARM9 with the Nitro-SDK Demo 
  "demos/fs/overlay-staticinit"
  
- fixed MTWX20416, A debug info isn't generated properly with the Nitro-SDK Demo 
  "demos/fs/overlay-staticinit"
  
- fixed MTWX20463, The result (quotient and remainder) of division is not right 
  when the FP_*_sz library is used.
  
- Added new pragma, force_func_export.

	#pragma force_func_export on|off|reset
	
  This pragma will force a function to be viewed as referenced by the compiler's code
  dead-stripper in -ipa file mode. This is useful for files that contain only C static
  declared functions. Normally, the compiler would simply dead-strip these functions
  since they have internal linkage and no references. Pragma force_func_export will
  mark the functions as referenced, preventing dead-stripping in the compiler in -ipa
  file mode. The scope of #pragma force_func_export remains in effect for each function
  parsed after the pragma until it is reset or set again. Example:
  
  #pragma force_func_export on
  func1() {}
  #pragma force_func_export off
  func2() {}
  
  force_func_export is enabled for func1() and disabled for func2() regardless of
  ipa mode settings.
  
  
  The behavior of the ARM 3.0 compiler in -ipa file mode differs  from
  the ARM 2.x compiler in deferred code generation mode. The behavior in -ipa file mode 
  is to dead-strip internal linkage object than are not referenced. Care must be exercised to
  address cases where unreferenced objects may have internal linkage. Whereas previous
  compilers may have exported these objects to the linker, the ARM3.0 compiler will
  dead-strip the objects. In particular, this happens in the NITRO SDK in 
  build/demos/fs/overlay-staticinit/src/top_menu.c and include/nitro/sinit.h.
  
  There are several options to make sure that unreferenced objects are exported to the
  linker. For functions, use pragma force_func_export described above. The __declspec
  (force_export) or __attribute__((force_export)) may be applied to individual objects
  to export them to the linker. This __declspec( or __attribute__) may be used on data or
  functions.

Examples:

// Somedata will not be dead-stripped in -ipa file mode

__declspec(force_export) static int Somedata[] = { 1,2 }; 

or 

static int Somedata[] __attribute__((force_export)) = { 1,2 }; 


  
- Changed handling of locally unreferenced global data definitions.

  For the most part, the ARM3.0 compiler tries to place all data in pooled ELF sections.
  That is, the data is placed in common physical sections. Since the relative locations
  of data is known in pooled sections, access to data is more efficient. The drawback
  of this is that the linker is unable to dead-strip unreferenced data since the linker
  can only strip the entire section.
  
  To overcome this deficiency, the compiler now recognizes whether global data definitions
  are locally referenced. That is, whether the global data is referenced within the
  file where it is declared. If the data is not locally referenced, it is placed in its
  own individual ELF section. This allows the linker to make the final decision on 
  dead-stripping. This feature is only active in -ipa file mode.
  
 

3.0 Build 109 (02-21-2006)

- fixed MTWX20373, wireless communication demos in CW for DS2.0 don't work 

3.0 Build 108 (01-31-2006)

- fixed MTWX18802, Debug info support for typedefs of base types 

- small refinement to lexical block support 


3.0 Build 107 (01-25-2006)

- Resolved ICE building NITRO C++ libraries, CTemplateTools.c:3833

- Resolved small lexical block info problem with local template class variables

3.0 Build 106 (01-24-2006)

- implemented MTWX17667, MTWX17669 - fixed point divide routine size was
reduced by re-rolling a loop. Overall mathlib size has been reduced due to
improved dead-stripping of unused math functions. User may now link in 
"_sz.a" type libraries to get improvement in code size of divide routines
for 32-bit signed and unsigned divide routine. But the smaller routines
are slower than the unrolled loop. The non-"_sz.a" libraries are smaller
also due to dead-stripping, but have the same performance as the previous
libraries.

- fixed MTWX19404, CW built-in assembler 'and' opcode bug. 

- implemented MTWX18350, the compiler now emits lexical block info in 
the DWARF2 .debug section.
 



3.0 Build 105 (01-18-2006)

MTWX14401 Feature has been reimplemented. The previous implementation of this
feature resulted in an unacceptable reduction in performance because all data
was un-pooled if "Pool Strings" were disabled. 

The new implementation un-pools only the string data objects if "Pool Strings"
is disabled. The bulk of the data objects remain pooled. This leads to slight
performance reduction that can be regained if "Pool Strings" is enabled. By
default, "Pool Strings" is disabled. So, ultimately, most of the data in
a translation unit is pooled into a single ELF .data section. Each individual
string resides in a unique ELF .data section when "Pool Strings" is off. 


A benefit of this feature is that strings can be globally aligned in the 
linker control file with an align directive.  
 
Example:

  .align all 8
   .data(*)

A caveat of this feature is that some unreferenced strings that possibly were
not dead-stripped previously by the linker can now be dead-stripped because they
live in unique ELF .data sections.


3.0 Build 104 (01-12-2006)

-fixed MTWX19913 

-fixed MTWX19914

MTWX14401 Feature
Want to disable "permit dead-stripping of functions" and 
disable "Pool Strings" at the same time.

The "Pool Strings" options in the C/C++ Language panel now controls the pooling
of constants. That is, when "Permit dead-stripping of functions" is disabled
and "Pool Strings" is disabled, each data object will occupy a unique ELF section.
Formerly, "Permit dead-stripping of functions", when disabled, would group all data
objects into a single ELF section, regardless of "Pool Strings" settings.


3.0 Build 103 (12-09-2005):
Notable changes from ARM 2.1 compiler:

o User specified read-only data sections may be specified with #pragma define_section.
example:
#pragma define_section mysection, ".mydata", ".mybss", ".myrodata", abs32, RWX

Use this pragma to place const qualified data in a user-specified section.
Otherwise, const data is placed in .rodata sections. 

o The compiler's inline assembler now accepts a .align directive
The usage is:
	.align <arg>

where <arg> is a literal constant (expressions are not allowed).
<arg> must be a power of 2 constant greater than 0. The maximum
align argument is 8192. 

.align aligns the next occurring instruction or directive to the
argument value. Multiple .align directives are allowed in an 
inline assembly block. 

Normally the function where the .align directive resides will be
aligned to the maximum of all the .align directives in the function.
This is true if dead-stripping of functions is enabled.

If dead-stripping is disabled in the compiler (target settings
panel "Permit dead-stripping of functions" is unchecked), individual
functions may not be necessarily aligned to the maximum of all .align
directives in the function. By disabling dead-stripping, the compiler
essentially combines functions in order to pool constants and gain
more efficient access of constant addresses of global and static 
variables. All the combined functions will reside in the same object
code section and the object code section is aligned to the maximum of the
.align directives. Do not rely on function alignment if dead-stripping
is disabled. The .align directives will be accurate, however.
  

o The compiler's inline assembler now accepts label operands in ldr and
lda instructions.

Example:
        asm {
                ldr r0,=L1
                lda r1,L2
L1:
L2:
        }

where L1 and L2 are legal inline assembly labels. Labels must be defined
in the function in which they are referenced.

o Inline assembly labels may now have an optional trailing colon.

Example:
	asm {
	label1
	b @label1
}

and 
	asm {
label1:
	b @label1
}

are identical. Label may begin anywhere in the line. The
lines containing a label may or may not contain additional opcodes.


o The command line flags to select warning levels have changed:

'-w most' enables the following warnings:

	"illegal #pragmas",
	"empty declarations",
	"possible unwanted effects",
	"unused arguments",
	"unused variables",
	"extra commas",
	"pedantic error checking",
	"hidden virtual functions",
	"passing large arguments to unprototyped functions",
	"use of expressions as statements without side effects",
	"lossy conversions from pointers to integers",
	"token not formed by ## operator",
	"return without a value in non-void-returning function",
	"inconsistent use of 'class' and 'struct'",
	"incorrect capitalization used in #include \"...\"",
	"incorrect capitalization used in #include <...>",

'-w all' enables the above warnings and the following:

	"implicit arithmetic conversions; implies '-warn impl_float2int,impl_signedunsigned'",
	"implicit integral to floating conversions",
	"implicit floating to integral conversions",
	"implicit signed/unsigned conversions",

'-w full' enables all of the above and the following:

	"use of undefined macros in #if/#elif conditionals",
	"'inline' functions not inlined",
	"padding added between struct members",
	"result of non-void-returning function not used",
	"any conversions from pointers to integers",

o The path to the runtime library is now Runtime/Runtime_ARM/Runtime_NITRO/lib.

- fixed MTWX19757, Inline assembler generates wrong code for "stmfd" when there are more than 15 registers as a reglist.

- fixed MTWX19648, Stand-alone Assembler (build 20) generates wrong instructions for "ldreq" and "ldrne".
