IMPORTANT. Read the following Freescale Software License Agreement
(ÅgAgreementÅh) completely. By selecting the ÅgI AcceptÅh button at the end
of this page, you indicate that you accept the terms of this Agreement.

FREESCALE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or as an
authorized representative of your employer) and Freescale Semiconductor,
Inc. ("Freescale"). It concerns your rights to use this file and any
accompanying written materials (the "Software"). This Agreement does not
concern your rights for software that has its own separate license
agreement. In consideration for Freescale allowing you to access the
Software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not
activate or install the Software. If you change your mind later, stop
using the Software and delete all copies of the Software in your
possession or control. Any copies of the Software that you have already
distributed, where permitted, and do not destroy will continue to be
governed by this Agreement. Your prior use will also continue to be
governed by this Agreement.

1. LICENSE GRANT.

Your rights to use this Software vary depending upon the particular
version of the Software product that you licensed. If you do not
remember this information you may contact the party from whom you
obtained the Software or us at www.freescale.com. This information is
also contained in the license file created when you install the
Software.

  a. Evaluation Period

    The Software may allow you to install it on a machine without paying
    a license fee. The Software will operate until a certain time elapses
    ("Evaluation Period") and will then automatically disable itself.
    Until then, Freescale grants to you, non-transferable right to install
    the software onto a single computer and to use the Software on that
    computer. You may not use the Software for commercial purposes during
    the Evaluation Period.

  b. Post Evaluation Period

    Node Locked License. If you purchased a node locked license (including
    a free license), then Freescale grants to you, the non-transferable
    right to install and use the Software on one computer.

    Floating & "Dongle" Licenses. If you purchased a floating or "dongle"
    license (including a free license), then Freescale grants to you the
    non-transferable right to install the Software on any number of
    computers and to simultaneously use a number of copies equal to the
    number of licenses that you purchased. A dongle means an electronic
    device that plugs into one of the communication ports of your computer.
    The product will automatically limit you to the correct number of
    simultaneous users. You may not interfere with this automated process.

    Academic Licenses. If you purchased an "Academic" license, then you may
    not use the Software for commercial purposes. You may only use the
    Software to teach and to perform research within an accredited
    educational institution.

  c. Limited Distribution Rights

    For node locked, floating and dongle licenses, Freescale also grants to
    you the right to prepare derivative works of and to distribute Compiled
    Software in object (machine-readable) form only and only as part of your
    own software programs that add substantial value to the Compiled
    Software. You may only distribute the Compiled Software for execution on
    processors sold by Freescale, directly or through distribution and
    processors that are compatible with the StarCore instruction set
    architecture ("Freescale Processor"). Compiled Software means the
    portion of the Software that is executable on a Freescale Processor,
    such as an embedded operating system, standard or "MSL" libraries,
    runtime libraries, example code and stationery code. Other components
    may also be distributed only if they are explicitly so marked in
    conjunction with that installed component.

2. LIMITATIONS.

If you benchmark the Software against other programs, then you may not
publicly disclose your results. You may not translate, reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble Software provided to you solely in object form
except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits such
restriction. In addition, you must prohibit your customers from doing
the same. If you violate any of the terms or restrictions of this
Agreement, Freescale may immediately terminate this Agreement, and
require that you stop using and delete all copies of the Software in
your possession or control.

3. TERM.

If you purchased a term license, then the Software will automatically
disable itself after the term expires. However, you may continue to
distribute Compiled Software. If you purchased a perpetual license, then
you may use the Software for as long as you like.

4. COPYRIGHT.

The Software is licensed to you, not sold. Freescale owns the Software,
and United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions
protect the Software. Therefore, you must treat the Software like any
other copyrighted material (e.g. a book or musical recording). You may
not use or copy the Software for any other purpose than what is
described in this Agreement. Except as expressly provided herein,
Freescale does not grant to you any express or implied rights under any
Freescale or third party patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade
secrets. Additionally, you must reproduce and apply any copyright or
other proprietary rights notices included on or embedded in the Software
to any copies or derivative works made thereof, in whole or in part, if
any.

5. PRODUCT SUGGESTIONS & SUPPORT.

Freescale is NOT obligated to provide any support, upgrades or new
releases of the Software under this Agreement. If you wish, you may
contact Freescale and report problems and provide suggestions regarding
the Software. You agree that Freescale may use your suggestions to
improve the Software. Freescale has no obligation whatsoever to respond
in any way to such a problem report or suggestion. Freescale may make
changes to the Software at any time, without any obligation to notify or
provide updated versions of the Software to you.

6. WARRANTY.

For a period of 90 days following delivery, Freescale only warrants that
the media on which the Software is provided, if any, will be free from
defects in material and workmanship. THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THE
WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT SPECIFIED IN THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED, TO THE FULL EXTENT THESE
MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW. If the media is not as warranted, Freescale
will, at its option, and as your exclusive remedy, either refund the
purchase price, repair, or replace with the same or equivalent Software
that meet this warranty. Freescale's obligations to correct errors in
the Software will be separately contained in a maintenance and support
agreement.

7. YOUR INDEMNITY TO FREESCALE.

You agree to defend and indemnify, at your expense, Freescale from any
and all claims, liabilities, and costs (including reasonable attorney's
fees) related to (1) your use (including your sublicensee's use, if
permitted) of the Software or (2) your violation of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

8. FREESCALE'S INDEMNITY TO YOU.

Freescale agrees to defend, at Freescale's expense, any Suit against
you, and will indemnify you for costs and damages (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) finally awarded in the Suit. "Suit" means a lawsuit
based on a Claim. "Claim" means a claim that the Software directly
infringes a U.S. patent or copyright, or misappropriates a trade secret.
Freescale will have no obligation to defend or indemnify you unless you:
(i) promptly notifies Freescale in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable after you first become aware of the Claim; and (ii) give
Freescale sole control of the Suit and all requested assistance for
defending the Suit. Freescale will not be liable for the settlement of a
Claim made without Freescale's prior written consent. Freescale will
have no obligation to defend or indemnify you if: (i) you or any third
party has altered the Software, and the alleged infringement would not
have occurred but for such alteration; (ii) you or any third party has
combined the Software with any other products or elements not furnished
by Freescale, and the alleged infringement would not have occurred but
for such combination; or (iii) the Software was designed or manufactured
in compliance with standards issued by a public standards body, and the
alleged infringement would not have occurred but for such standards. If
the use or permitted resale of any Software is enjoined as a result of a
Suit, Freescale, at Freescale's option, and at no expense to you, will:
(i) obtain for you the right to use or distribute the Software; (ii)
substitute an equivalent product(s) reasonably acceptable to you and
extend this indemnity to that product(s); or (iii) accept the return of
the Software and refund the purchase price paid for the Product to you,
less a reasonable charge for prior use, if any. Freescale will not be
liable for damages in excess of (i) a reasonable royalty rate on the
Software that is the subject of the Claim, multiplied by (ii) the
revenue derived by Freescale from license to you of the Software.
THIS SECTION CONTAINS (I) FREESCALE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND ALL
OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR
MISAPPROPRIATION, AND (II) YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AGAINST FREESCALE
FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

FREESCALE'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL COSTS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS,
INDEMNIFIABLE CLAIMS, OR LOSSES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR PRODUCT(S) SUPPLIED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.

10. DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT WILL FREESCALE BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR ANY LOSS OF
USE, LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, COMMERCIAL LOSS, OR LOST PROFITS,
SAVINGS, OR REVENUES TO THE FULL EXTENT SUCH MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.

11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.

You must use the Software in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws,
regulations and statutes. You agree that neither you nor your licensees
(if any) intend to or will, directly or indirectly, export or transmit
the Software to any country in violation of U.S. export restrictions.

12. GOVERNMENT USE.

If you distribute the Software to the United States Government, where
permitted, then the Software is "restricted computer software" and is
subject to FAR 52.227-19 (c)(1) and (c)(2).

13. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

You acknowledge that the Software is not fault tolerant and is not
designed, manufactured or intended by Freescale for incorporation into
products intended for use or resale in on-line control equipment in
hazardous, dangerous to life or potentially life-threatening
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air
traffic control, direct life support machines or weapons systems, in
which the failure of products could lead directly to death, personal
injury or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk
Activities"). You specifically represent and warrant that you will not
use the Software or any derivative work of the Software for High Risk
Activities.

14. CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE; LIMITATIONS.

You agree that the statutes and laws of the United States and the State
of Texas, USA, without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will
apply to all matters relating to this Agreement or the Software, and you
agree that any litigation will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state or federal courts in Texas, USA. You agree that regardless
of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Software must be
filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
be forever barred.

15. PRODUCT LABELING.

You are not authorized to use any Freescale trademarks, brand names, or
logos.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and
Freescale regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes
all prior communications, negotiations, understandings, agreements or
representations, either written or oral, if any. This Agreement may only
be amended in written form, executed by you and Freescale.

17. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid
or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will
be unimpaired and, unless a modification or replacement of the invalid
or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or Freescale
of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately
terminate, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with
a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the
intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision.

18. NO WAIVER.

The waiver by Freescale of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a
subsequent breach of the same or a different provision.
